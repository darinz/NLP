# 03. Rapid Adaptation

## Introduction

Rapid adaptation refers to techniques that enable large language models to quickly adjust to new tasks, domains, or user requirements with minimal data, compute, and time. This is crucial for deploying models in dynamic, real-world environments.

## Why Rapid Adaptation?

- Real-world tasks and domains change frequently.
- Collecting large labeled datasets for every new task is impractical.
- Efficient adaptation enables personalized and up-to-date AI systems.

## Key Techniques for Rapid Adaptation

### 1. Prompt Engineering
- Design effective prompts to steer model behavior without retraining.
- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting enable instant adaptation.

### 2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
- Update only a small subset of model parameters (e.g., LoRA, adapters, prefix tuning).
- Reduces training time and resource requirements.

### 3. Meta-Learning (Learning to Learn)
- Train models to rapidly adapt to new tasks with few examples.
- **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML):** Learns an initialization that can be quickly fine-tuned.

**MAML math:**

```math
\theta^* = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta L_{\text{new task}}(\theta)
```
where $`\theta`$ is the meta-learned initialization.

### 4. Continual and Online Learning
- Update models incrementally as new data arrives.
- Avoids catastrophic forgetting with regularization or replay buffers.

## Python Example: Few-Shot Adaptation with PEFT (LoRA)

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, TaskType
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Configure LoRA for rapid adaptation
lora_config = LoraConfig(task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM, r=4, lora_alpha=8, lora_dropout=0.05)
peft_model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
peft_model.print_trainable_parameters()

# Now, only LoRA parameters will be updated during a quick fine-tuning session
```

## Key Takeaways
- Rapid adaptation is essential for practical, real-world AI deployment.
- Prompting, PEFT, and meta-learning enable fast, efficient adaptation.
- Hugging Face PEFT and prompt engineering make rapid adaptation accessible.
