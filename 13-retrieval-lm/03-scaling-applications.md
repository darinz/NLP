# 03. Scaling and Applications

## Introduction

Scaling retrieval-based language models involves increasing model size, data, and retrieval capacity to improve performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. This guide covers scaling strategies, challenges, and real-world applications, with math and code examples.

## Why Scale Retrieval-Based Models?

- Larger models and corpora improve factual accuracy and reasoning.
- Scaling retrieval enables access to more knowledge and up-to-date information.
- Real-world applications require robust, scalable solutions.

## Scaling Strategies

### 1. Model Scaling
- Increase the number of parameters in the generator (e.g., BART, T5, GPT-3).
- Use distributed training and inference for large models.

### 2. Retrieval Scaling
- Index larger corpora (e.g., Wikipedia, Common Crawl, enterprise data).
- Use efficient vector search (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) for fast retrieval.
- Shard and parallelize retrieval across multiple machines.

### 3. Multi-Hop and Compositional Retrieval
- Retrieve and reason over multiple documents to answer complex queries.

**Multi-hop math:**

```math
P(y | q, C) = \sum_{d_1, d_2 \in C} P(y | q, d_1, d_2) P(d_1, d_2 | q, C)
```

## Python Example: Scaling Retrieval with FAISS

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Create a large random index (e.g., 1M vectors of dimension 768)
d = 768
nb = 1000000
xb = np.random.random((nb, d)).astype('float32')
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)
index.add(xb)

# Query
xq = np.random.random((5, d)).astype('float32')
D, I = index.search(xq, k=5)  # Find 5 nearest neighbors for each query
print("Indices of nearest neighbors:", I)
```

## Real-World Applications

- **Enterprise Search:** Retrieve and generate answers from internal documents, emails, and knowledge bases.
- **Legal and Medical QA:** Access large, domain-specific corpora for accurate, up-to-date answers.
- **Customer Support:** Scale to millions of FAQs, tickets, and product docs.
- **Academic Research:** Summarize and answer questions from vast scientific literature.
- **Personal Assistants:** Provide users with timely, factual information from the web.

## Key Takeaways
- Scaling retrieval-based LMs improves accuracy, coverage, and robustness.
- Efficient retrieval (e.g., FAISS) is critical for large-scale applications.
- Real-world use cases span enterprise, healthcare, research, and more.
