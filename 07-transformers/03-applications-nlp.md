# 03. Applications of Transformers in NLP

## Introduction

Transformers have revolutionized NLP, enabling state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Their self-attention mechanism and parallelization capabilities make them the foundation for modern language models.

## 1. Machine Translation

Transformers are the backbone of neural machine translation systems (e.g., Google Translate).
- Input: Source language sentence
- Output: Target language sentence

## 2. Text Summarization

Transformers generate concise summaries of long documents using encoder-decoder or encoder-only architectures (e.g., BART, T5).

## 3. Question Answering

Models like BERT and RoBERTa are fine-tuned to answer questions given a context passage.

### Example: Using Hugging Face Transformers for QA

```python
from transformers import pipeline
qa = pipeline("question-answering")
context = "The Transformer architecture was introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. It uses self-attention to process sequences in parallel."
question = "Who introduced the Transformer architecture?"
result = qa(question=question, context=context)
print(result["answer"])
```

## 4. Text Classification

Transformers are used for sentiment analysis, topic classification, spam detection, and more.

## 5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Transformers label entities in text (names, locations, organizations, etc.).

## 6. Language Modeling & Text Generation

Large transformer models (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3) generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

### Example: Text Generation with GPT-2

```python
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
result = generator("Transformers are", max_length=20, num_return_sequences=1)
print(result[0]["generated_text"])
```

## 7. Paraphrase Generation & Text Similarity

Transformers can generate paraphrases and compute semantic similarity between sentences.

## 8. Dialogue Systems & Chatbots

Modern chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) are built on large transformer models, enabling natural and context-aware conversations.

## Key Takeaways
- Transformers are the foundation of modern NLP applications.
- Pretrained models can be fine-tuned for a wide range of tasks.
- Libraries like Hugging Face Transformers make it easy to use state-of-the-art models.
