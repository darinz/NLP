# 02. Benchmark Datasets

## Introduction

Benchmark datasets are standardized collections of data used to evaluate and compare NLP models. They provide a common ground for measuring progress and identifying strengths and weaknesses across different approaches.

## Why Benchmark Datasets?

- Enable fair, reproducible comparison of models.
- Cover a wide range of NLP tasks and domains.
- Drive progress by setting clear performance targets.

## Key Benchmark Datasets in NLP

### 1. GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)
A collection of tasks for evaluating natural language understanding:
- **SST-2:** Sentiment analysis
- **MNLI:** Natural language inference
- **QQP:** Paraphrase detection
- **QNLI:** Question answering

### 2. SuperGLUE
A more challenging successor to GLUE, with harder tasks and more complex reasoning.

### 3. SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
- Reading comprehension: answer questions based on Wikipedia passages.

### 4. CoNLL-2003
- Named entity recognition (NER) for English and German.

### 5. WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation)
- Machine translation benchmarks for many language pairs.

### 6. Common Crawl, WikiText, and OpenWebText
- Large-scale datasets for language modeling and pretraining.

## Python Example: Loading Benchmark Datasets with Hugging Face Datasets

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

glue = load_dataset("glue", "sst2")
print("GLUE SST-2 train size:", len(glue["train"]))

squad = load_dataset("squad")
print("SQuAD train size:", len(squad["train"]))

conll = load_dataset("conll2003")
print("CoNLL-2003 NER train size:", len(conll["train"]))
```

## Choosing the Right Benchmark
- Select datasets that match your task (classification, QA, NER, etc.).
- Consider dataset size, domain, and difficulty.
- Use multiple benchmarks for a comprehensive evaluation.

## Key Takeaways
- Benchmark datasets are essential for fair model evaluation.
- GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD, and CoNLL-2003 are widely used in NLP research.
- Hugging Face Datasets makes it easy to access and use benchmarks.
