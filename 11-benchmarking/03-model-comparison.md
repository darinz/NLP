# 03. Model Comparison

## Introduction

Model comparison is the process of evaluating and contrasting different NLP models to determine which performs best for a given task. This involves using standardized metrics, datasets, and statistical analysis to ensure fair and meaningful results.

## Why Model Comparison?

- Identify the best model for your application.
- Understand trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and resource usage.
- Guide model selection, deployment, and further development.

## Steps for Effective Model Comparison

### 1. Use Standardized Metrics and Datasets
- Evaluate all models on the same benchmark datasets and with the same metrics (see previous guides).

### 2. Perform Statistical Significance Testing
- Use statistical tests to determine if observed differences are meaningful.
- **Paired t-test** and **bootstrap resampling** are common methods.

### 3. Consider Resource Usage
- Compare models in terms of inference speed, memory usage, and parameter count.

### 4. Analyze Error Cases
- Examine where models succeed or fail to gain deeper insights.

## Mathematical Perspective: Paired t-test

Suppose you have two models, A and B, and their scores on $`n`$ test samples: $`(a_1, b_1), ..., (a_n, b_n)`$.

The paired t-test statistic is:

```math
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
```
where $`\bar{d}`$ is the mean difference $`(a_i - b_i)`$ and $`s_d`$ is the standard deviation of the differences.

## Python Example: Comparing Two Models with scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from scipy.stats import ttest_rel

# Example predictions
y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred_a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  # Model A
 y_pred_b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  # Model B

acc_a = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred_a)
acc_b = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred_b)
print(f"Model A Accuracy: {acc_a:.2f}")
print(f"Model B Accuracy: {acc_b:.2f}")

# Paired t-test
scores_a = [int(y_true[i] == y_pred_a[i]) for i in range(len(y_true))]
scores_b = [int(y_true[i] == y_pred_b[i]) for i in range(len(y_true))]
t_stat, p_value = ttest_rel(scores_a, scores_b)
print(f"Paired t-test: t={t_stat:.2f}, p={p_value:.4f}")
```

## Visualization: Model Performance Comparison

Visualize results with bar charts, confusion matrices, or ROC curves for a comprehensive comparison.

## Key Takeaways
- Compare models using the same metrics and datasets.
- Use statistical tests to validate differences.
- Consider both accuracy and resource efficiency.
